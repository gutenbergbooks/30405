<h1><span class="sp1">The Clean and<br />
Wholesome Land</span></h1>

<h2>By Ralph Sholto</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">While</span> Professor Cargill lectured
from the rostrum,
Neal Pardeau prowled the dark auditorium.
This, he knew, was the
place to find them. Here was where
they whispered and plotted and
schemed&mdash;feeling safe in this pure,
hard core of patriotism.</p>

<p>Safe because Cargill was the Director
of Education in the New
State, just as Pardeau was the Director
of Public Security. Safe because
Cargill's lectures were given
before a commanded audience,
with attendance strictly mandatory.</p>

<p>The insistence was not really
necessary of course. The people
would have come to hear Cargill
regardless. His was a compelling,
magnetic personality. Even now his
great voice was booming out:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and upon this anniversary of
the New State, we can look out with
great pride upon a clean and wholesome
land. With strong emotion,
we can look upon the physical
manifestation of our glorious principles&mdash;that
only through self-effacement&mdash;through
fanatic love for
the state&mdash;can the individual come
to complete physical and mental
fruition. Upon this anniversary
we see our enemies, both within and
without, broken, and completely
subjugated&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was the place they whispered
and schemed and plotted.
Pardeau prowled the aisles, his
eyes piercing the darkness&mdash;spotting
them, cataloguing them. And
thus he came upon Emil Hillerman,
his Deputy of Vital Intelligence sitting
dutifully in the end seat of a
middle aisle. Hillerman's thick lips
hung lax, his eyes squinted laboriously
as he sought to follow the
thread of Cargill's lecture.</p>

<p>Pardeau tapped Hillerman on the
shoulder. The latter started guiltily.
He whirled and sought to identify
Pardeau in the semi-darkness. Pardeau
said, "Please step outside with
me. I have some questions."</p>

<p>There was fear in Hillerman's
bearing as he got clumsily to his
feet and followed Pardeau. But
none of Cargill's speech was missed.
A battery of loudspeakers carried
it even into the foyer where Pardeau
stopped and turned on Hillerman.
He regarded the man through cold,
calculating eyes. He seemed to be
both enjoying Hillerman's discomfort
and also listening to Cargill's
booming words.</p>

<p>"&mdash;these pale weaklings, these
traitors with twitching muscles and
twitching minds who skulked in
dark places have been finally and
decisively defeated. Even their
vaunted leader&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have you been doing,"
Pardeau asked, "relative to Karl
Lenster?"</p>

<p>The frightened Hillerman licked
his fat lower lip as he sought
for words. "Everything&mdash;everything
possible. But Lenster is clever. You
know that. You know that yourself."</p>

<p>Pardeau's eyes bored into those
of the Intelligence Director. They
were noted for their icy penetration,
but upon this night they were
like steel knives. It was as though
he surveyed Hillerman from behind
the bulwark of some new and
hostile information. Even as he
stared, Cargill was booming from
the rostrum:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Karl Lenster, their <i>peerless</i>
leader&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Cargill's voice crackled with
the inflections of pure contempt.</p>

<p>"&mdash;a degenerate&mdash;a dope addict
whose greatness lay only in the
realms of his sensual dreams. A
weak, pitiful figure bereft of followers,
cringing alone in&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Pardeau spoke, his voice
held a new sharpness to complement
the new ice in his eyes. He
said, "In half an hour I am attending
a meeting of the Council. They
will want a report. What about
Lenster?"</p>

<p>Hillerman looked quickly to right
and left, then back at his Chief. He
hesitated as though fearing the consequences
of what he was about to
reveal. "You know of the Wyckoff
Chemical Transformation Process&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly I know of it," Pardeau
blazed. "What about it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" But Hillerman seemed
to lose the courage he'd screwed
up to continue in this direction. He
straightened and a little of the
hangdog servility dropped away. "I
am doing all that is humanly possible
to apprehend Lenster. All that
any man could do. The secret jails
are full. My interrogators work
night and day. Even a superficial
check of my records would show
that more has been done in the last
six months and is being done now
than&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pardeau raised an impatient
hand, opening a gap of silence into
which the voice of Cargill poured.</p>

<p>"&mdash;land in which the voice of
dissenter is not heard; in which
Lenster and men of his despicable
ilk are forever crushed and beaten&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pardeau was scowling. Almost
unconsciously he had held the
pause, with hand upraised, until
Cargill finished his passage. As Cargill
stopped for breath, Pardeau
jerked his hand down sharply, completing
the gesture. "I have no time
for any more of this. And I resent
having to seek you out. Next time
report to my office as is proper and
keep me posted as to your activities.
Next&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pardeau eyed Hillerman for one
blank moment and allowed the
threat to reflect clearly that possibly
there would not be many more
next times. Then he turned and
strode swiftly from the foyer.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Cargill's</span> voice had hardly
faded when he picked it up
again on his car radio. It was a
foregone conclusion that every
radio in the land would be tuned
to the lecture. So great was Cargill's
popularity that every citizen
traveling in a car would wish to
hear it and turn on his receiver. It
was foolish not to have a radio
properly tuned when Cargill spoke.
He was saying:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and so under the banner of
complete solidarity, we will march
forward, a solid phalanx against
which no force can stand. Now that
our own house is swept clean of vermin&mdash;rid
forever of carrion like
Lenster and his ilk, we can&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pardeau had traveled swiftly
through the streets at the high speed
reserved for higher servants of the
New State. Lesser servants of the
New State had learned caution and
thus no regrettable deaths or maimings
occurred; the lesser servants
having grown wary and fleet of
foot.</p>

<p>Pardeau switched off his motor
but left his radio blaring. Cargill's
voice followed him up the broad
steps of the Executive Building and
was just fading out when Pardeau
was able to pick it up again from
the loudspeaker under the great
arches.</p>

<p>He entered the building and
traversed the vast foyer to a niche
which housed a private elevator. He
entered the lift, deserting it on the
ninth floor, where he entered an
unobtrusive door and joined a
group which consisted of the New
State's well guarded pool of power
and brains.</p>

<p>There was Blanchard of Finance; Keeley,
Director of Foreign Education;
Masichek, overlord of the
nation's larder, and seven others.</p>

<p>When Pardeau entered, all conversation
stopped and every man
looked up from a luxurious overstuffed
chair. Pardeau must certainly
have swelled inwardly with
pride at this unconscious tribute.
It was well known that he held a
key position on the chessboard of
politics. His was in reality the most
important job of all. It was to Pardeau
that this powerful group of
men looked for that which they
most treasured&mdash;their own personal
safety.</p>

<p>A chair was waiting for Pardeau.
He said, "I'm sorry to be late, gentlemen.
I have been on a personal
tour of inspection. I'm sure you will
forgive me however. I have a most
interesting report."</p>

<p>He seated himself, timing the action
so it coincided with the ebb of
applause coming over the speaker&mdash;applause
from the loyal multitudes
who had just heard Professor
Cargill end his lecture. As it
was now permissible, Blanchard
reached under the table and
snapped a button. The speaker went
silent.</p>

<p>"An interesting report?" Keeley
asked.</p>

<p>"Amazingly so," Pardeau said. "I
have just unearthed a traitor&mdash;a
traitor in a high place."</p>

<p>Every man in the group strove
not to react and this striving was in
itself a reaction. "Most interesting,"
Blanchard murmured. "Are you
ready to name names?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention, but in
order to forestall a great many questions,
let me give you a complete
background."</p>

<p>Leiderman, Ambassador without
Portfolio, and very close to the
Man of Almost Sacred Name who
never attended these meetings, felt
strong enough to evince impatience.
"The name, man! First the name.
Then the details."</p>

<p>Pardeau smiled coldly. "Very
well. The name is, Karl Lenster."</p>

<p>Leiderman sprang from his chair,
his face bordering on purple. "Is
this a joke, Pardeau? We all know
Lenster is the arch-traitor of our
times&mdash;the leader of the resistance
movement. Talk sense!"</p>

<p>Pardeau, not in the least disconcerted,
smiled coldly. "I'm sorry.
Perhaps I should have said Emil
Hillerman, my Deputy of Vital Intelligence,
the man who holds immeasurable
power in his two
hands."</p>

<p>Blanchard was not given to outbursts.
But his lips were grim as he
said, "We are waiting for you to
talk sense, Pardeau."</p>

<p>"The confusion comes from your
not allowing me to tell it as I
wished. There is a gap between
Lenster and Hillerman; one which&mdash;with
your permission&mdash;I will fill."</p>

<p>"Talk, man! Talk!"</p>

<p>"You have all heard of Formula
652, known also as the Wyckoff
Chemical Transformation Process."</p>

<p>There were expressions of both
understanding and bewilderment.
Noting these, Pardeau said, "For
those of you who haven't made a
point of looking into the thing, I'll
explain. Wyckoff, in case you don't
recall, was a chemical engineer of
more than average ability who
stumbled onto this formula before
he died, most regretfully, four years
ago, in 1984."</p>

<p>Leiderman continued to scowl.
"We all know each other, Pardeau.
Call a spade a spade. Wyckoff was
a reactionary scoundrel whom you
did away with for reasons of security."</p>

<p>"Precisely," Pardeau said. "In its
essence, the formula is a process for
taking over a man's brain&mdash;his body&mdash;his
personality."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pardeau refused to be interrupted.
"We were of the opinion
that Wyckoff, though he and Lenster
were great friends, was not able
to impart his knowledge to the latter.
We took him into custody
shortly after he perfected the formula
and were fortunate in persuading
him to give it to us."</p>

<p>"But he gave it to Lenster also?"</p>

<p>"We were certain, at the time of
his death, that he had not been able
to do that&mdash;we are still certain."</p>

<p>Keeley, with a gesture, requested
the floor. "I wonder if you could go
into a little more detail concerning
the formula&mdash;for those of us
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," Pardeau said. "The
formula is a combination of six
chemicals and the process of transformation
is relatively simple, yet
highly dangerous to both subjects
involved. It means sure death for
the proposed host, and if not delicately
handled will also result in
death for the usurper. The transformation
requires three hours to
perform. Once completed successfully,
the usurper can never return
to his own body. It must be
destroyed. Also, the mentality of the
host vanishes after it is pushed from
its original brain tissue through the
influence of the formula."</p>

<p>"Then if Wyckoff didn't give the
formula to Lenster, it was stolen
from our vaults&mdash;or wherever
it was kept?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Certain investigations
I have made prove beyond doubt
that Lenster got to my Deputy,
Hillerman. I never considered Hillerman
very bright, but I thought
him to be honest and loyal. But beyond
all doubt, with his aid, Lenster
stole the formula&mdash;possibly got it
verbally&mdash;and used it to take Hillerman's
body from him." Pardeau
smiled grimly. "Therefore, gentlemen,
we have a traitor in a high
place. My Deputy of Vital Intelligence."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Pardeau</span> sat silent now, seeming
to enjoy the fear he had engendered
in his colleagues&mdash;sat silent
until Leiderman said, "You've
arrested him of course."</p>

<p>"No. I have not."</p>

<p>"Then get at it, man&mdash;get at it."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of arresting
Hillerman."</p>

<p>Leiderman's eyes widened as did
those of the rest of the company.
But Blanchard, even under the
impact of such a bombshell had
the presence of mind to glance at
his watch. Immediately he snapped
on the loudspeaker. The voice of
Professor Cargill blared forth:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and upon this anniversary of
the New State, we can look with
pride upon a clean and wholesome
land&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was the rebroadcast, from recordings,
of Cargill's speech and no
man in his right mind would have
refrained from tuning it in because
everyone wanted to hear it at least
twice.</p>

<p>Leiderman, almost apoplectic,
ignored the speech. "Not arresting
him! Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"I'm quite sane, and the situation
is well in hand." Pardeau grinned
and there was wickedness in the
grin&mdash;wickedness and intelligence.
"As I said before, Hillerman was
not a smart man. His job was too
much for him and I would have
been faced, soon, with the necessity
of replacing him regardless. Lenster,
on the other hand, is of grade-A
intellect. But, gentlemen, he is
frightened&mdash;badly frightened in his
new environment&mdash;and, in order to
insure his own safety, is doing an
excellent job. Ever since the transformation,
that department has
gained in efficiency until it now
ranks as one of the highest in our
entire government."</p>

<p>Slowly, Pardeau's strategy
dawned on the group. Blanchard
suddenly smiled. Then Pardeau
scowled and went on with a new
and sudden ferocity. "I have the
proof, and I have Lenster-Hillerman
under my palm. So he stays&mdash;continues
to do a good job for us.
But he'll be watched, gentlemen.
He won't be able to go to the bathroom
without being under surveillance.
We will learn a great deal
from him. All we need to know."</p>

<p>"Then you'll arrest him?" the
boss of the state larder wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Pardeau came to his feet. His fist
slammed down on the table. "I
shall <i>not</i> arrest him&mdash;ever. When
the time comes, I shall personally
shoot him down in the street like a
dog. There will come a day, gentlemen,
when you will witness this
act of vengeance&mdash;when I shall
make such an example of Lenster-Hillerman
as the resistance will not
forget&mdash;a morale-crumbling example,
I promise you."</p>

<p>"&mdash;in which Lenster and his ilk
are forever crushed and beaten,"
the speaker said.</p>

<p>Blanchard took the floor. "Gentlemen&mdash;I
move a vote of thanks
and confidence for our colleague,
Neal Pardeau."</p>

<p>The Director of Public Security
stood at attention and assayed a
sharp, military bow. It was a moment
of rare triumph. "Thank you,
gentlemen," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>An hour later, Lenster-Pardeau
was alone in his apartments. He
stripped off his uniform with an
air of grim satisfaction. While he
undressed, he thought of the martyrs
to the Cause; the men who had
died. He thought of Wyckoff and
wished Wyckoff could have had
the pleasure of knowing who had
usurped the body of Neal Pardeau&mdash;Pardeau
the Butcher&mdash;the infamous
Pardeau.</p>

<p>From the speaker came the third
and final rebroadcast of Cargill's
speech:</p>

<p>"&mdash;a clean and wholesome
land&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A clean and wholesome land,"
Lenster murmured, and the tone
of his voice was a prayer.</p>
